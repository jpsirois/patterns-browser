## Patterns Availanle
* The 356 first [SubtlePatterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/)
* Transparent variants of 154 SubtlePatterns made by @halgatewood

* Grid view of all the Patterns, by library
* Fullscreen background view of all the Patterns, by library

## Todos & Ideas

All Todos & Ideas is tracked in the [project issues](https://github.com/jpsirois/patterns-browser/issues).

## Browsers Supports
* Best performances in Safari & Firefox
* Chrome seems to struggle a bit when there’s a lot of Patterns loaded at the same time in the Grid layout when the viewport of the computer is really large. Tested at a 2560x1440 resolution on a Mid 2013 13" Macbook Air.
* Once loaded it is pretty smooth on iOS7. Tested on an iPhone 5.
* Not tested in any IE version yet
