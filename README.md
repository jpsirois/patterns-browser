# Patterns Browser

A quickly put up simple web view to have a quick and easy way to browse Patterns.

## Patterns Availanle
* The 356 first [SubtlePatterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/)
* Transparent variants of 154 SubtlePatterns made by @halgatewood

## Features
* Grid view of all the Patterns, by library
* Fullscreen background view of all the Patterns, by library

## TODOS

* Add a background-color changer for the transparent variation
* Update with the all the latest [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/) submissions. Right now contain all the Pattern from their not updated anymore [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns). [Last update](https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns/commit/6e056565a1254c967228aab60c9d9c7d0e63a7e3) on 2013-08-06.
* Clean SCSS & HAML structure, I used stuff from another of my project and it may have some useless things for the current project purpose.
* Add the metadata for each Pattern if available
* Add more Patterns library
* Add more views

## Browsers Supports
* Best performances in Safari & Firefox
* Chrome seems to struggle a bit when there’s a lot of Patterns loaded at the same time in the Grid layout when the viewport of the computer is really large. Tested at a 2560x1440 resolution on a Mid 2013 13" Macbook Air.
* Once loaded it is pretty smooth on iOS7. Tested on an iPhone 5.
* Not tested in any IE version yet

## Thank you

* @halgatewood for providing [transparent variations of 150 Subtle Pattern](http://halgatewood.com/150-transparent-subtle-patterns/)
